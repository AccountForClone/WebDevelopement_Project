# Web Development-1 Capstone Project

The Web Development-1 Capstone Project's purpose is to provide an informational

resource for visitors to Windsor Botanical Gardens & Arboretum. Visitors to the

website can find information on upcoming events, sign up for activities and learn 

about the many gardens. The website will also include location, hours of operation 

and helpful rules and guidelines. 

This project was created as final project for Code Louisville's web development 1 

program. Although fictional, Windsor Botanical Gardens & Arboretum was inspired by 

my visit to an arboretum in Washington D.C..
